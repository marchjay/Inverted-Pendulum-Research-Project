# Inverted-Pendulum-Research-Project
 Research project including the design and implementation of an inverted pendulum.
 Currently working on the matlab control strategy for the pendulum and the communication between the system -> arduino -> matlab
 Using an Adafruit ADS1015 to receive ADC measurements from 2 potentiometers on the pendulum which are converted to an angle value for the pendulum and 
 position value for the cart. 
 Additionally, a Sparkfun TB6612FNG motor driver controls the pwm signals from the arduino to control the 12V DC Motor for the cart.
